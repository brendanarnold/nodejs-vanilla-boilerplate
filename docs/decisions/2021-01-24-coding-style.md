# Use StandardJS for code style

## Status

24 January 2021 - Confirmed

## Description

New projects should follow a coding standard to ensure consistency

## Decision

Use StandardJS

StandardJS is well supported, widely used, clear and offers further benefits, such as identifying unused variables, which when coupled with IDE integration captures lots of bugs as you type.
